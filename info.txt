Well this is the mail automating system for the development of the mailing the designated authorities 

- Nodemailer will act as the transporter here 
- Bull will provide the queue data structure of the Redis database.Cron scheduling is then used to schedule 


Context : 
  i) The mail system should check the emails which are unresolved for every 15 days 
  ii) Now we have to initially create the jobs in particular format . It should contain the Details of the complaint and as well as the attachments 
  iii) As soon as the job is produced we will dynamically construct the email and will create an object of the related details and email 
  iv) Now these job objects are queued into the queue created by the bull and then processed by the registered processor function
